## Used Technologies

### Python / Django

Django was preferred because backend and view will be used together in this project.
However, it may be more appropriate to use _django-rest-framework_ for further development of the project.

### SQLite

SQLite was used to make the project available quickly in different environments.
Thus, there was no need to run a stand-alone database.
<br><br><br>
_This project is backend based, but Bootstrap and JS are used to make frontend improvements fast._

## Prerequisites

Other library requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`, to install with pip use following command:<br>
```bash
pip3 install requirements.txt

python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

**Default Super User Credentials:**

## Features

- **Instant Search** <br> 
    User can search cities instantly on home page without seeking within pages.
- **Unit** <br>
    User can choose unit while searching cities.
- **Cookie for Last Viewed City**<br>
    When the user enters the page, the last viewed city information is kept and the weather for that city is displayed.
    If the city is changed, the cookie information is also updated. This method is also applied to unit data.
- **Import Cities Command**<br>
    User can import cities via Django command line interface with using<br> `python3 manage.py import_cities docs/city.list.json` command.
